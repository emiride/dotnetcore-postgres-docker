# dotnetcore-postgres-docker

This is a showcase of how easy it is to map multi layer application locally using Docker. 
The only pre-requisite is having Docker installed locally. For Linux, you need to have docker-compose as well.

1. git clone https://github.com/emiride/dotnetcore-postgres-docker.git
2. cd dotnetcore-postgres-docker
3. docker-compose build
4. docker-compose up
5. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/swagger
